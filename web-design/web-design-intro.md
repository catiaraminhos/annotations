Design
======

Introduction
----------

**Design** is about people (and improving their daily life)

**Design** is about extremes (after that, is easy to deal with the things in the middle)

**Design** is about an interaction between a person and an object

Users react positevely when things are clear and understandable; don't include superfluous things. When the design is an extension of us, it is human, it dissolves with human behaviour.

Good design is:
  * innovative
  * making a product useful
  * aesthetic
  * making a product understandable
  * honest
  * unobtrusive
  * long-lasting
  * thorough down to the last detail (completion, accuracy)
  * environmentally-friendly
  * little design as possible (more natural as possible; it should not exist another way to design it)

Design steps:
  1. Look to the logic form of the object
  2. Look to the symbolic meaning and the content of the object (the small rituals, e.g, making coffee)
  3. Give a context to the object (in a global way)


What is Design?
-----------------

* A method to solve physic and virtual problems.


**Interaction Design**

* Goal: Help people to experience and to manipulate software and interfaces, to achieve their desires and needs.
* _User Interface Design_: user interaction must be the simplest and the most efficient as possible (emphasys on goals and finishing tasks).
  - Balance functionality and visual elements, in order to make the system usable and adaptable to the user needs.
* _User Experience Design_: "incorporates aspects of psychology, anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design, industrial design and cognitive science".
  - Create useful, simple and "imperceptible" interactions between the user and the product.
