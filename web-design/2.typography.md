The emotional response to a content will be different with different typefaces (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3YDAtcsKmg>).

Parts of a Typography

* **Type size** (or Cap Height): overall height (includes capital letters height)
* **Ascender**: upward tail of some letters (e.g., b, d, h, ...)
* **Descender**: downward tail of some letters (e.g., q, p, j, ...)
* **Counter**: whitespace inside some letters (e.g., o, p, ...)
* **X height**: height (without ascenders and descenders)
* **Baselines**: "the boundary that the lowest part of the letter rests"
* **Kerning**: the white space between letters (affects readability)
* **Leading**: the white space between lines (affects readability)


Type alignment
--------------
* **Left alignment**: default writing; easy to read text; usually for **body text**.
  Use cases: Casual letters, unpublished manuscripts and basic paragraph styles.
* **Center alignment**: to draw attention; usually for **headings or titles**.
  Use cases: Newspaper headers, book titles and report titles.
* **Right alignment**: more **professional** (formal) look.
  Use cases: corporate business letters, address labels, business cards...
* **Justified alignment**: usually for **newspapers and books**' body text.
  Note: Be careful with "rivers" of white space (tracking).


Type category
-------------
* **Serif**: strokes on the ends of the letters. Easy to read for longer pieces (used more for print).
  Example: Times New Roman.
* **Sans-serif**: without strokes on the ends of the letters. Used more for screens and more heavily for labelling, headlines and titles.
* **Script, symbols and decorative**: to create a specific image or message.
  Examples: for a wedding invitation, a script type; for a child's birthday invitation, a decorative type.


Web fonts
---------
* Be careful with character set available in the picked font.
* **Fallback fonts**: used to replace original font, when a character is not available. The fallback font should be similar to the original font.
* **Numerals**: some fonts have numerals according to the use case, for tables (tabular figures), mixed text (oldstyle figures) and all caps text (lining figures).
* Don't fake styles and use the proper font versions of bold and italics.
  Exception: faking small caps when they are not available. Use the bolder weight (when a semi-bold variant is available) to adjust the darkness of the text and give a little extra character space.
* Learn the HTML entities: <https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html#h-24.1>.
  - Apostrophes are defined as `&rsquo;`, not as quotation mark.
  - There are different type of dashes:
    * **Figure dash**; usually not available and the hyphen is used
	* **En dash**; connection between items, ranges, two competitors or alternatives; &ndash; (`&ndash;`)
	* **Em dash**; colon-like use, parenthesis-like use, differences in ponctuation, interruption, quotation; &mdash; (`&mdash;`)
* Text sizes must be defined in `em` in relation to the standard body text size.
* Types of spaces:
  - **Figure space**: as wide as a numeral of the typeface (useful for tables)
  - **Non-breaking space**: ensure that adjacent words will always be on the same line
  - **Em space**: as wide as the type size
  - **Ponctuation space**: as wide as the dot or the comma
  - **Thin spaces**: between the dot and the next letter in abbreviated names
  - **Hair spaces**: between a dash and the neighboring characters
* Space between letters < space between words < space between lines
* Don't increase space between letters in lowercase text
* Headlines will benefit from tigter tracking (but don't overuse it)
